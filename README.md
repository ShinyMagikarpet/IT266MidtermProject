# IT266MidtermProject

Summary: Starfox has has automatic forward velocity applied to the player at all times. 
The only control players can have for the forward velocity is the ability to move slower or faster. 
Another feature is the ability to lock on to enemies by charging up your gun.

Setup: Personally I've never been able to get the gamex86.dll to work from my pak files directly. 
Instead what I've been doing was putting the .dll in the quake 4 directory (\Games\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Quake 4). 
You can start the game however you like but there is a save files with an enemy and some weapon upgrades spawned and ready for 
testing in Hover_Monster_Spawn.

Controls:

  - Steering - mouse
  - Shoot - LMB
  - charged shot - hold LMB
  - Superbombs - F
  - Speed boost - spacebar
  - brakes - left shift
  
NOTES: Game will most likely crash if you are in charged state and boost/brakes at same time. Probably handled some code poorly. 
Also rate my beatiful main menu.
